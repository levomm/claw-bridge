# PocketDev runtime bundles

Runtime bundles are release artifacts, not device backups. They are built from
the official Ubuntu ARM64 base and architecture-matched upstream tool archives,
so they are portable across Android phones that expose the `arm64-v8a` ABI.

The rooted phone is only an ARM64 build host. No Motorola system files, Android
partitions, Magisk files, device identifiers, or user data are included.

## Bundle layout

- `core`: Ubuntu, Node, Git, and a pinned Claude Code ARM64 fallback. PocketDev
  checks for a newer Claude release when validated internet is available, but a
  failed or offline update never blocks setup.
- `python`: Python, pip, venv, and build tools. Downloaded only when selected.
- `android`: a portable JDK 17, Android SDK, ARM64 build tools, Gradle, the
  offline Maven repository, and PocketDev's global ARM64 AAPT2 configuration.
- `cpp`: GCC, G++, make, CMake, and GDB.
- `php`: PHP CLI, common extensions, and Composer.
- Claude Code remains separate so PocketDev can install or update Anthropic's
  signed ARM64 binary independently of the larger runtime bundles.

The current artifact metadata and SHA-256 checksums live in
`dist/runtime-bundles/manifest.json`. Large `.tar.zst` files and downloaded
source archives are intentionally ignored by Git and must be published as
release assets or copied into the app's release asset input.

## Compatibility

These artifacts are universal for 64-bit ARM Android devices; they are not tied
to the phone used to build them. They do not support x86/x86_64 emulators or
32-bit-only ARM devices. PocketDev must continue checking for `arm64-v8a` before
installation.

## Release requirements

1. Build on a clean ARM64 Linux environment or a rooted ARM64 Android phone
   using a clean Ubuntu chroot.
2. Verify every downloaded source archive against its pinned SHA-256 checksum.
3. Remove package caches, logs, temporary files, resolver state, SSH host keys,
   machine IDs, and shell histories.
4. Create deterministic archives with numeric root ownership and a fixed mtime.
5. Extract each completed archive into a fresh directory and execute its tools.
6. Publish the archive and manifest together. Sign the manifest with a private
   release key kept outside this repository before production distribution.
